### Abstract

React Native has been used across Microsoft a lot, over the last few years. Only recently, though, we have realized how its developer experience and its community are in a precarious situation. We decided, then, to approach the problem in the most impactful way possible: by going straight to the source! Join us in this talk to hear what we are doing to make life better for everyone in the community, from open sourcing new tools, to creating new cross-company groups and even in collaborating directly with Meta in the core codebase (and not just there!). As a smart person once said: “a rising tide lifts all boats” - and we, we want to be the moon!
