### Abstract

One of the main potentials of react-native is the flexibility it provides in terms of native platforms the code can be ported to. At Microsoft, where desktop is a key part of our customers' experience, we took this opportunity to take cross-platform experiences to be used in our macOS apps. To do so, we had to embark on a journey of the scary "out of tree" platform, which had many challenges and still has! Come with me Saad this trip, where he'll share with you how we implement and maintain React Native macOS, and talk about what kind of apps can be built with it!

#### App.js Conf 2023

App.js Conf is a React Native & Expo-focused conference organized by Software Mansion. The last edition was a blast! We've brought together over 330 developers from all around the world, listened to over 20 talks by React Native professionals, discussed the present and the future of mobile development and danced till morning at the afterparty! Join us in May 2023 and we promise to deliver even a better experience than before.
