### Abstract

React Native is often subject to drama and a lack of communication, leading to a lack of trust. In my conference talk, I'll shed light on the under-appreciated work of developers improving the technology, with the hope of restoring your faith in its future.

#### Chain React 2023

Chain React is a three-day event in Portland, Oregon exploring the latest in React Native. Leaders from companies like Meta, Amazon, and Expo all send their developers to Chain React to announce the latest news, make lifelong connections, and advance the industry.
