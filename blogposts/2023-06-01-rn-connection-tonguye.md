### Abstract

At Microsoft, we're committed to providing our teams with the best tools and technologies to build high-quality mobile applications. React Native has long been a preferred choice for its high performance and great user experience, but getting stakeholders on board can be a challenge. In this talk, we will share our journey of making React Native a preferred choice for stakeholders who prioritize ease of integration and developer experience. We'll discuss the specific strategies we used to achieve our goal and the results we achieved.

#### React Native Connection 2023

React Native Connection is the first French conference entirely dedicated to the community of React Native developers.

This Spring, enjoy a full afternoon of talks by internationally renowned speakers and chat with fellow developers from all over France and Europe!
