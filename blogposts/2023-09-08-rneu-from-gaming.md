### Abstract

React Native is used to build features across a large portfolio of applications at Microsoft, and in this talk we will describe several such experiences and how we built them. We will also cover updates to React Native for Windows and macOS, tools that we've built to enable React Native adoption at scale, and our contributions to the overall ecosystem.
